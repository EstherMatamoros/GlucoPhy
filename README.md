# Glucose Level Measurement using Proteus and Arduino

This project uses Proteus and Arduino to measure glucose levels in the body using sensors for temperature, heart rate, and electrodermal activity. Linear regression is used to calculate glucose levels from the sensor data.

## Hardware
- Arduino board
- Proteus simulation software
- Temperature sensor
- Heart rate sensor
- Electrodermal activity sensor

## Software
- Arduino IDE
- Linear regression algorithm

## Project Description
The project uses Proteus to simulate the interaction between the sensors and the Arduino board. The sensors collect data on temperature, heart rate, and electrodermal activity, which is then sent to the Arduino board for processing. The Arduino board uses a linear regression algorithm to calculate the glucose level based on the sensor data. The calculated glucose level is then displayed on the Proteus simulation.

## Results
The project successfully demonstrates the use of Proteus and Arduino for measuring glucose levels in the body using sensors for temperature, heart rate, and electrodermal activity. The linear regression algorithm provides accurate glucose level calculations.

## Conclusion
This project shows that Proteus and Arduino can be used as an effective tool for non-invasive glucose level measurement. The use of linear regression for glucose level calculation provides a reliable and accurate method for monitoring glucose levels in the body.
